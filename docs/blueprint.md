# **App Name**: Scriptify AI

## Core Features:

- Department Selection: Allow users to select a department (ETG or Booking.com) to filter scripts.
- Script Display: Display relevant chat scripts based on the selected department and filters.
- Copy to Clipboard: Enable one-click copying of the scripts or sub-scripts (conversation flows).
- Filter Scripts: Implement a filter dropdown menu to categorize scripts.
- Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to quickly find specific scripts or phrases.
- Theme Customization: Allow users to customize the theme with pre-defined glass-morphism options: Black and Blue, Black and Red, Black and Green, Black and White, and White and Red.
- AI-Powered Refinement: Use a tool that employs generative AI to optionally refine the script based on chat context and sentiment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to provide a sense of trust, dependability, and clarity, fitting a professional chat tool.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#2B3035) as the background to give a dark-themed appearance and good contrast.
- Accent color: Bright red (#FF4500) used sparingly for highlights and interactive elements to catch the user's eye without being distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for its modern, machined, objective, and neutral look that assures readability for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons for navigation and actions. The icons should maintain a consistent line weight.
- Implement a clean, card-based layout with glass morphism effects to ensure scripts and sections are clearly segmented. Favor generous spacing.
- Subtle transitions and animations on hover and click events to provide feedback and enhance user experience.
